Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed from the set
by the DELETE operation is prespecified. In a stack, the element deleted from
the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a last-in,
first-out, or LIFO, policy.

Similarly, in a queue, the element deleted is always the one that
has been in the set for the longest time: the queue implements a first-in,
first-out, or FIFO, policy.

In this section we show how to use a simple array to implement
evenly spaced
evenly spaced text test
and one very long line that is very long so long it is more than eighty characters oh so long
