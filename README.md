# TextFormatter
Educational Project in Java with Swing

This project is intended to format text based on flags embedded in the unformatted text. The current repository contains the basis for a GUI, there is no event handling so far. The point of this is to be have a model we can use for a user guide which is due much further in advance than the final product. The class this is for is supposed to develop robust customer interaction practices, and understanding of how to work on a software team.
